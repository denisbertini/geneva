This folder contains CMake modules needed for building Geneva or used alongside
of it. Currently it holds:

- the CMake 3.0 version of FindBoost.cmake, as some older versions seemed to be broken,
- a module for finding the Geneva library in the file system,
- a module used to try to identify the host system and compiler details,
- a module used to clean up the CMake build folder,
- a module containing shared functionality for the Geneva "full tree" build,
  and for independent builds of the examples or test programs.
