Installation instructions for this software are short at this time.

You will need a copy of Boost (see http://www.boost.org). Currently we
recommend a combination of gcc 4.2.1 and Boost 1.34.1 to compile the
code. It was developed and has been tested on an OpenSUSE 10.3 Linux
box. Particularly the combination of gcc 4.3.1 and Boost 1.35 appear
to be problematic.

The supplied configure script still has some deficiencies. Currently, in order to compile the code, we recommend to run the command

autogen.sh; ./configure --prefix=/where/geneva/should/go --with-boost=/Boost/directory
