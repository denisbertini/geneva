Installation instructions for this software are short at this time. 

You will need a copy of Boost (see http://www.boost.org), in version
1.36.  You will also need to add the threadpool library (have a look
at http://threadpool.sf.net).

The build system now uses CMake in version 2.6, which is required due
to the availability of the FindBoost macro.

In order to compile this project and the examples:
- If your copy of Boost is installed in a non-standard location, edit the
top-level CMakeLists.txt file and specify this directory (BOOST_ROOT, 
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and BOOST_LIBRARYDIR). 
- Create a build directory anywhere in the file system and change into it. 
Then call "cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir/", followed by a simple "make".

The CMakeLists.txt files are still a bit preliminary. Some paths are
hardcoded in the top-level CMakeLists.txt file.
