Target systems
==============

The Geneva library has been developed on OpenSUSE systems (version 11 at the time
of writing of this text). While it is likely that the same code will compile on 
other Linux and possibly Unix platforms (particularly if gcc versions newer than 
4.3 are used), no attempt has been made so far to do this. The author would very
much appreciate your feedback, if you manage to compile the library on other systems
than OpenSUSE 11. 

Building and Installing
=======================

The build system now uses CMake in version 2.6, which is required due
to the availability of the FindBoost macro.

You will need a copy of Boost (see http://www.boost.org), in version
1.36.  You will also need to add the threadpool library (have a look
at http://threadpool.sf.net). It is assumed that the threadpool library
is installed in the same location as Boost 1.36 (i.e., you have copied
the files and directories recursively to /where/boost/resides/boost .

In order to compile this project and the examples:
Create a build directory anywhere in the file system and change into it. 
Then call 

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir

followed by a simple "make".

In order to choose a custom installation directory (instead of the default 
/usr/local), call

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/where/the/library/goes"
 
Note that under Linux, you will have to make the installation directory 
known to the linker, so henceforth you can link to the library. Under OpenSUSE 11,
this can be done by creating a file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/geneva.conf with the content

/where/the/library/goes/lib

You then need to execute "ldconfig -v".

Most Linux distributions are still delivered with Boost 1.34 . You might thus have 
compiled your own version of Boost, and have installed it in a non-standard location. 
In order for CMake to find this directory, you can either edit the top-level
CMakeLists.txt file and hard-code the paths (uncomment the appropriate entries there),
or provide the necessary variables at the command line when calling cmake. This can 
be done in the following way (assuming that Boost is installed in /opt/boost136):

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir -DBOOST_ROOT="/opt/boost136"\
                              -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR="/opt/boost136/include/boost-1_36/"\ 
                              -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR="/opt/boost136/lib"

Adding another define -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" or -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
switches between Release (default) and Debug builds.

The command needs to be called on a single line. 

This commands shown here were tested on an OpenSUSE 11 system.

Recommended Software
====================
By default a GenEvA population emits information suitable for the ROOT framework 
(see http://root.cern.ch). ROOT is a C++ analysis framework wideley used in particle
physics. It is built around the C++ interpreter cint. It is recommended to install
ROOT in your system, as also some of the examples emit information in the ROOT format
(they are essentially writing ROOT programs).
