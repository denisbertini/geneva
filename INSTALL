Target systems
==============

The main development work of the Geneva library collection is currently done
on Ubuntu and Debian. It is likely that Geneva compiles on most other Linux
and Unix systems using the GNU Compiler Collection. The main branch of Geneva
development in Launchpad is built and tested nightly under
	Ubuntu 14.04,
	Ubuntu 12.04,
	CentOS 7,
	CentOS 6, and
	FreeBSD 9
using different Boost versions ranging from 1.48 to 1.55, using GCC versions
4.4 to 4.8 or CLang versions 3.0 to 3.4, and different compiler settings. See
Gemfony's autobuild system for more details:
	http://build.gemfony.eu/index.php?project=Geneva

We have also recently managed to compile Geneva on MacOS 10.9 using the Clang
compiler, which comes with the development suite. Note that support for MacOS
is experimental at best.

Geneva has also been tested to compile and work under Windows both using the
MS Visual C++ 12.0 ("Visual Studio Express 2013 for Desktop") compiler and the
Cygwin environment.

The authors would very much appreciate your feedback through the Geneva
Development Forum http://www.gemfony.eu/index.php?forums .

In case you encounter any bugs or issues please let us know through the Geneva
bugtracker: https://bugs.launchpad.net/geneva

For further information, please also have a look at our user-manual, available
from the Downloads section of our web page.


Prerequisites
=============

The build system uses CMake in version 2.8 or later. CMake 3.0 is recommended.

You will also need the Boost libraries (see http://www.boost.org) in version
1.48 or newer. Relying on the libraries provided by your system is the recommended
way to install Boost. Alternatively, you may want to compile and install a custom
Boost from source, see the Appendix "Compiling Boost" below for more details.
We currently recommend Boost version 1.55 .

Please do make sure that Boost has been compiled with the same C++ standard
mode that you wish to use for Geneva (in particular, do not mix libraries
compiled in C++11 and C++98 mode).

If you wish to build from the source code available from our version control 
tree you will also need the Bazaar version control tools. This is not needed 
if you only intend to build the official releases from the provided "tar balls".


Installation prerequisites on Debian/Ubuntu
-------------------------------------------

The following commands should be enough to install the required prerequisites
in any reasonably modern Debian/Ubuntu release (Debian 6, Ubuntu 10.10 or later):

sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends cmake bzr g++

sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost-dev libboost-date-time-dev \
        libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev \
        libboost-serialization-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-test-dev \
        libboost-thread-dev


Installation prerequisites on MacOS X (tested only on 10.8)
------------------------------------------------------------

You should first install the Xcode environment from the App store. This
will give you a working C++ compiler. You should also install Mac versions
of CMake and bzr.

We recommend that you compile a custom boost version. With Boost 1.57,
unpack the archive, then run the following commands inside of the main
directory of the boost source tree:

./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/opt/boost157/
sudo ./b2 -j 4 install

This assumes a system with 4 cores. The directories can of course be adapted.

MacOS contains two incompatible std C++ libs: libstdc++ and libc++ . With MacOS 10.9,
libc++ has become the default. In order to compile Geneva with Mavericks (a.k.a. 10.9)
you need to make sure that libstdc++ is being used both in Boost and in Geneva. All
necessary modifications have been made in the Geneva build files so that the code 
(hopefully) compiles cleanly with libstdc++ . For Boost, however, you need to do some
manual work:

- Create a file /etc/site-config.jam with the following content (or add the lines to
an existing file, you could also use user-config.jam in your home-directory, if your
are unsure about creating a system-wide configuration file):

using clang : 98
    : "/usr/bin/clang++"
    : <cxxflags>"-std=c++98 -stdlib=libstdc++" <linkflags>"-stdlib=libstdc++ -macosx_version_min=10.8"
    ;
    
This will enforce the usage of libstdc++ and the 98 C++ standard.

- bootstrap boost, then call

./b2 -j4 -d+2 toolset=clang-98 define=BOOST_SYSTEM_NO_DEPRECATED variant=release threading=multi address-model=64 stage install

Through the increased verbosity (through -d+2) you can check that the correct
arguments are passed to the compiler.

NOTE that Geneva does not currently seem to compile with MacOS 10.10 (Yosemite) .

Installation prerequisites on Cygwin
------------------------------------

Installing the following packages should be enough to compile Geneva
under CygWin:

        gcc-core
        gcc-g++
        make
        cmake
        libboost-devel
        libboost_*1.55  (at least you need: date_time,filesystem,
                         program_options,regex,serialization,system,thread)

Then build Geneva as in any Unix system, see "Building and installing
Geneva" below.

Installation prerequisites on Windows
-------------------------------------

See the documentation file INSTALL.Windows in this same folder.


Building and installing Geneva
==============================

To build the Geneva library on Unix-based systems use one of the two
procedures enumerated below. See the documentation file INSTALL.Windows
in this same folder for compilation instructions on a Windows system.


a) The easy (but more restricted) way
-------------------------------------

Geneva comes with a build script that facilitates the somewhat complicated
call to cmake. Assuming you are in $HOME/build and Geneva is in $HOME/Geneva,
copy the config file over:

cp ../Geneva/scripts/genevaConfig.gcfg ./myGenevaConfig.gcfg

Adapt the variables in the file appropriately. Then call

sh ../Geneva/scripts/prepareBuild.sh ./myGenevaConfig.gcfg

Finally build and install in the usual way:

make		# Use the -j2 switch if you have a dual core CPU
sudo make install  # Assuming you want to install to a system directory

You can clean up the build folder by running "make clean" inside of $HOME/build .


b) Direct call to cmake
-----------------------

In order to compile this project and the examples:

Create a build directory anywhere in the file system and change into it.
Then call

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir

followed by a simple "make" and "make install".

In order to choose a custom installation directory (instead of the default
/opt/geneva), call

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/where/the/library/goes"

Somewhat older distributions won't provide a new enough version of Boost
(i.e., at least 1.48). You might thus have compiled your own version of
Boost, and have installed it in a non-standard location. In order for
CMake to find this directory, you can either edit the top-level
CMakeLists.txt file and hard-code the paths (uncomment the appropriate
entries there), or provide the necessary variables at the command line
when calling cmake. This can be done in the following way (assuming that
Boost is installed in /opt/boost155):

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir -DBOOST_ROOT="/opt/boost155"

Alternatively, if you installed Boost in some non-standard directories,
you may try defining both the include and library locations:

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR="/opt/boost155/include" \
                              -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR="/opt/boost155/lib"

Adding another define -DGENEVA_BUILD_TYPE="Release" or -DGENEVA_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
switches between Release and Debug (default) builds.

Adding a -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE="1" will allow you to see the command
line that was used to call the compiler.

This command needs to be called on a single line.

Have a look at the configuration script prepareBuild.sh for some of the options 
available for a direct call to cmake,


Making the libraries known to the system
========================================

a) On Linux
-----------

Note that under Linux, you will have to make the installation directory
known to the linker, so henceforth you can link to the library automatically. 
Under most Linux systems this can be done by creating a file 
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/geneva.conf with the content

/where/the/library/goes/lib

You then need to execute "ldconfig -v". 

Another possibility is to export the library location prior to running 
programs based on Geneva:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/where/the/library/goes/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

You should follow a similar procedure for the boost libraries, if you
have compiled your own version of it.

b) On MacOS
-----------

Currently we simply set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to the Geneva and Boost 
library directories. Please do let us know about more convenient ways
of permanently setting library paths.

c) On Cygwin
------------

On Cygwin, like in Windows itself, you only need to add the DLLs to your
path to allow the system to use them:

export PATH="/where/the/library/goes/lib:$PATH"


Recommended Software
====================

By default a Geneva optimization emits information suitable for ROOT
(see http://root.cern.ch). ROOT is a C++ analysis framework widely used
in particle physics. It is built around the C++ interpreter cint. It is
recommended to install ROOT in your system, as also some of the examples
emit information in the ROOT format (they are essentially writing ROOT
programs). Note, though, that ROOT is not required to perform
optimization with the Geneva library collection.


Appendix: Compiling Boost on Linux
==================================

Download Boost from http://www.boost.org and extract the compressed file.
This will create a folder "boost_1_55_0", for instance. Change to that
folder and, assuming Boost should be installed in /opt/boost155 (which
should be writable), execute

./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/opt/boost155
sudo ./b2 install

You can add a "-j 2" to the second command if your system has two cores.
This will speed up the otherwise quite long compilation time.

Once done you can use the Boost include path as explained above, with
BOOST_ROOT="/opt/boost155".

If FindBoost.cmake has trouble finding the Boost libraries in the specified
location, it might help to compile the library with the flag
"--layout=versioned" or "--layout=tagged".


Appendix: Known bugs and (possibly) fixes on some platforms
===========================================================
