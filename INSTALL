Installation instructions for this software are short at this time. 

You will need a copy of Boost (see http://www.boost.org), in version
1.36.  You will also need to add the threadpool library - have a look
at threadpool.sf.net .

The build system now uses CMake in version 2.6 . In order to compile
this project and the examples, create a build directory and change
into it. Then call

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir/

followed by a simple "make".

The CMakeLists.txt files are still a bit preliminary. Some paths are
hardcoded - Boost should reside in /opt/boost136 at this time. Also
the target installation directories default to whatever CMake chooses.
This is work in progress.
