Installation instructions for this software are short at this time. 

You will need a copy of Boost (see http://www.boost.org), in version
1.36.  You will also need to add the threadpool library (have a look
at http://threadpool.sf.net).

The build system now uses CMake in version 2.6, which is required due
to the availability of the FindBoost macro.

The CMakeLists.txt files are still a bit preliminary. Some paths are
hardcoded in the top-level CMakeLists.txt file.

In order to compile this project and the examples:
- If your copy of Boost is installed in a non-standard location, edit the
top-level CMakeLists.txt file and specify this directory (BOOST_ROOT, 
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR and BOOST_LIBRARYDIR). 
- Create a build directory anywhere in the file system and change into it. 
Then call 

cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir

followed by a simple "make".

In order to choose a custom installation directory (instead of the default 
/usr/local), call

 cmake /path/to/geneva-top-dir -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/where/the/library/goes"
 
Note that under Linux, you will have to make the installation directory 
known to the linker, so henceforth you can link to the library. Under OpenSUSE 11,
this can be done by creating a file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/geneva.conf with the content

/where/the/library/goes/lib

You then need to execute "ldconfig -v".
