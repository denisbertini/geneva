General questions:
==================

Q: What does "Geneva" stand for ?
A: Geneva stands for "Grid-enabled evolutionary algorithms". The library will ultimately
   implement a multitutde of different optimization algorithms. However, as evolutionary
   algorithms were the first to be implemented, and as Geneva started life in conjunction
   with Grid computing and particle physics, which in turn are closely related to CERN in
   Geneva/Switzerland, the name still seems to be appropriate.

Q: Are there bugs ?
A: Yes.

Q: Ummmh -- so if there are bugs, why don't you fix them ?
A: We have done our best to check the Geneva library for all kinds of possible problems.
   Particularly, there is a comprehensive unit test framework for the core optimization
   libraries. So the actual number of bugs should be quite low. However, we cannot test
   Geneva under all possible circumstances. This is where, in the best tradition of Open
   Source software, we rely on YOU to report the problems you have encountered. Also note
   that there may be known bugs that we are currently working on, that we currently consider
   to have such a low priority that we have chosen to work on other parts of Geneva first,
   or which are simply impossible to fix, as they are related to problems of a particular
   execution environment.

Q: Where to report bugs or wish items ?
A: https://bugs.launchpad.net/geneva

Q: Where to post general questions about the Geneva usage or development ?
A: Please use the Geneva Usage or Development Forums:

Technical questions:
====================

Q: Why do member functions of Geneva classes do not carry the "throw(...)" specifier ?
A: In former releases, throw() specifiers were used to list the exceptions a function
   could throw. A rationale for the decision to remove these specifiers can be found
   here: http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill22.htm .

Q: When I run one of the examples in networked mode (either on the local box or over a LAN/WAN), 
   the optimization stops reproducibly after a few hundred iterations. Is this a bug ?
A: The Geneva library assumes that evaluation functions run for a (possibly very) long time.
   Consequently clients disconnect from the server as soon as they have received a work item,
   and reconnect, once they have finished the calculation. The examples shipped with the
   library, in turn, mostly implement evaluation functions that run for a few milliseconds.
   This means that a lot of connections are opened and closed in a very short time. You might
   then quickly run out of ports, whose number is limited on Linux (you can find this out with
   the command "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range"). One remedy is explained here:
   http://www.speedguide.net/read_articles.php?id=121 (search for TCP_TW_REUSE). The command 
   suggested there is "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse". NOTE THAT YOU NEED TO
   CAREFULLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF SETTING THIS VARIABLE ON YOUR SYSTEM. See also a 
   related 2007 discussion on the Boost.Asio Usenet forum (quoted e.g. here: 
   http://osdir.com/ml/lib.boost.asio.user/2007-06/msg00101.html). The situation
   is actually very similar to a web server with a high volume of requests, and you will
   experience similar problems. There are many more tuning options in the Linux kernel for
   you to play with. Google will give you further information (search e.g. for "Apache tuning"
   and possibly sysctl.conf -- there are examples of configuration files only which help
   you to tune the server system).

Q: Which CPP macro variables are used at build time and can be defined by the user ?
A: The following variables are available for deeper control of some aspects of the code
   at compile time:

     GEM_COMMON_BENCHMARK_BOUNDED_BUFFER
        Enables the generation and output of benchmarking information by
        common/GBoundedBufferT.hpp . Mostly to be used in code tests, not for general
        consumption.

     GEM_GENEVA_USE_LOCAL_RANDOM_ADAPTION
        Produce random numbers locally for mutations in geneva/GMutableSetT.hpp
