Q: What does "Geneva" stand for ?
A: Geneva stands for "Grid-enabled evolutionary algorithms". The library will ultimately
   implement a multitutde of different optimization algorithms. However, as evolutionary
   algorithms were the first to be implemented, and as Geneva started life in comjunction
   with Grid computing and particle physics, which in turn are closely related to CERN in 
   Geneva/Switzerland, the name still seems to be appropriate.

Q: Why do member functions of Geneva classes do not carry the "throw(...)" specifier ?
A: In former releases, throw() specifiers were used to list the exceptions a function
   could throw. A rationale for the decision to remove these specifiers can be found
