Known Bugs and issues
=====================

Likely due to a problem with the termination of singletons in the Boost.Serialization
library after main() has ended, some Geneva programs will segfault at the end of the
program execution for Boost versions 1.44 - 1.46 . This should not affect the
results of the optimization in any way, though.

If you run into an error message "looser throw specifier for Ôvirtual boost::exception_ptr::~exception_ptr()Õ" 
with Boost 1.41, make sure to add a line "~exception_ptr() throw() { }" to the file 
"$BOOST_HOME/include/boost/exception_ptr.hpp", around line 93 . This happens e.g. with gcc 4.4.7 on
CentOS 6.3 .
