Almost all Geneva programs currently suffer from a segmentation fault
at the end of their execution. This is likely caused by a thread that
was started from one of the global singletons that hasn't been
terminated at this point. Inspection of the relevant classes didn't
give an indication of the culprit, though. This is an ongoing problem
that shouldn't affect optimization.
