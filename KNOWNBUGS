Almost all Geneva programs currently suffer from a segmentation fault
at the end of their execution. All functions started from main have
terminated at this time. So this is likely caused by a thread that
was started from one of the global singletons that hasn't been
terminated at this point (RandomFactory, Logger or a Broker Instance). 
Inspection of the relevant classes didn't give an indication of the 
culprit, though. This is an ongoing problem that shouldn't affect 
optimization.
