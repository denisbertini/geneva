On OpenSUSE 11 / 64 bit / g++ 4.3.1, as well as Ubuntu 8.04 and Debian Lenny, Geneva 
programs currently suffer from a segmentation fault at the end of their execution. All 
functions started from main have terminated at this time, and the crash does to the best
of our knowledge not affect the program result. The problem seems to be caused by a 
bug in the Boost 1.36 serialization library. A post on the Boost mailing list on 
September 15, 2008 yielded the following answer:

"This has been previously reported and fixed in the trunk. I hope to merge
this into the release branch before the end of the month."

Removing the two lines 

#include <boost/serialization/export.hpp>
BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT(Gem::Geneva::GParabolaIndividual)

at the end of GParabolaIndividual.hpp makes the segfault go away. Not
including these lines can result in problems when using serialization functionality, though.

Update: The problem seems to be gone with Boost 1.38 . In order to make finding that library 
easier, we recommend to also upgrade to CMake 2.6.3 (or use that version's FindBoost.cmake
macro).
