On OpenSUSE 11 / 64 bit / g++ 4.3.1, Geneva programs currently suffer 
from a segmentation fault at the end of their execution. All functions 
started from main have terminated at this time. The problem seems to be 
caused by a bug in the Boost 1.36 serialization library. A post on the
Boost mailing list on September 15, 2008 yielded the following answer:
"This has been previously reported and fixed in the trunk. I hope to merge
this into the release branch before the end of the month."
Removing the two lines 

#include <boost/serialization/export.hpp>
BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT(Gem::GenEvA::GParabolaIndividual)

at the end of GParabolaIndividual.hpp makes the segfault go away. Not
including these lines can result in problems when using serialization functionality, though.
