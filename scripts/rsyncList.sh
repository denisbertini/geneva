# This script will sync a local directory with another directory 
# on a list of remote hosts specified in a file. Note that it may be 
# useful to use ssh-agent or to avoid specifying a passphrase during 
# key generation in order not having to enter the passphrase for each 
# ssh call. You can call this script like this:
# ./rsyncList.sh -av -e ssh ./ myHostFile.hcfg:/home/user/somedir --delete-after
# Or in other words: Instead of specifying a remote host name, you
# provide the script with the name of a file holding host names.
# The host file should list one name of a remote host per line. Its
# extension MUST be ".hcfg". The script will stop execution when one of 
# the rsync calls fails.
