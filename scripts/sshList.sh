# This script will use the ssh program to execute a given command
# on all hosts specified in a file. Note that it may be useful to use
# ssh-agent to avoid specifying a passphrase during key generation
# in order not having to enter the passphrase for each ssh call. You
# can call this script like this:
# ./sshList.sh -p 24 -l myUserName ./myHostFile.hcfg myCommand
# The host file should list one name of a remote host per line. Its
# extension MUST be ".hcfg". "myCommand" may itself be a command with
# arguments. The script will stop execution when one of the ssh calls
# fails.
