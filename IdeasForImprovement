- Add cross-over function to GParameterCollectionT
- Let the GRandomFactory only create [0,1[ random numbers, but create an automatic adaption of the number of producer threads
- Make the GRandomFactory class a producer / integration with condition variables -> faster execution
- Let the GRandomFactory class produce simple arrays of doubles instead of Boost's array class -> faster execution
- Shifting in multi-populations
- Prevent GBrokerPopulation from being used inside itself (doesn't make sense, will likely not work)
