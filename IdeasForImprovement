- Add cross-over function to GParameterCollectionT
- Shifting in multi-populations
- Prevent GBrokerPopulation from being used inside itself (doesn't make sense, will likely not work)
- Make individuals output their information in ROOT-tree format (see http://root.cern.ch)
- Move from GLogger to one of the two Boost logging library candidates. Requires that at least one 
  of them heads for a review (we do not want to include further candidate libraries - Geneva should work 
  with a vanilla Boost installation (>= 1.36)
- Ship the threadpool library with Geneva
- Add many tests using the Boost.Test library
- Allow to set a maximum sigma for gauss mutations when using adaption of that value!!!
