- Create a look-up table for the sin() and other functions in the gauss-random facility. Is this really faster than calculation of a sin in the processor ?
- Add cross-over function to GParameterCollectionT
- Let the GRandomFactory only create [0,1[ random numbers, but create an automatic adaption of the number of producer threads
- Bring the GRandom classes into their own namespace and make it independent of GenEvA, so that the framework can develop independently
