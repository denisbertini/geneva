/*
 * This code is meant as an incubator that facilitates "playing" with new
 * optimization algorithms. It uses some of the conventions common in the
 * Geneva optimization library (see http://launchpad.net/geneva), and thus
 * may be useful if you wish to build new algorithms to be integrated into
 * Geneva. It currently only supports double-type parameters. If you want
 * other parameter types, you can "emulate" them -- 0. is false and 1. is
 * true for boolean types, 0.,1.,2. ... would represent integer types.
 *
 * Some code in this file was contributed by Lisa Schaetzle.
