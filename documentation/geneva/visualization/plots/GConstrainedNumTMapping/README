This directory contains various files that illustrate 
the behaviour of the GBoundedDouble class. In particular:
- realMapping.pdf (created with GBoundedDoubleTest),
  transferFunction.odg / transferFunction.pdf show how bounded 
  values are achieved in the GBoundedDouble class
- gaussianMapping.png (also created with GBoundedDoubleTest) 
  shows how gaussian-distributed random numbers on the internal
  representation of the GBoundedDouble "behave" on the outside.
  In particular, it is important to note that the "mapped" 
  values still have a largely gaussian shape (up until the limit)
