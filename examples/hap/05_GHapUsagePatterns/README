This sample program illustrates the access to random numbers 
through a proxy object, using different random number types 
and distributions.

There is no visible effect when calling this program, it will 
just print some status flags and exit. However, by looking at the
code, you can learn about some typical usage patterns when interfacing
with the Hap proxy "GRandom".
