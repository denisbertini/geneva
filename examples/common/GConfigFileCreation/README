This directory contains a demo on how to create and parse
configuration files with the GParserBuilder class.

Simply run the executable "GConfigFileCreation". It will automatically
create a configuration file below the "config" directory for you. This
is actually also typical of all of Geneva. If there is no configuration
file available, but a directory "config" exists, calling the executable
will create configuration files with default values. These may then
be modified.

Configuration files use the JSON ("Java Script Object Notation") format.
There is a complete framework in Geneva for creating parsers for configuration
files and coupling them to your classes. Have a look at the source code 
of GConfigFileCreation.cpp and also check out the chapter in our manual.
