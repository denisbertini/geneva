This folder contains CMake modules needed for building Geneva or used alongside
of it. Currently it holds:

- a module for finding the Geneva library in the file system,
- a module used to try to identify the host system and compiler details,
- a module containing shared functionality which can be used for the Geneva
  "full tree" build, or for independent builds of the examples and test programs,
- a module used to clean up the CMake build folder.
