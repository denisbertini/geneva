This directory contains a simple Geneva application that searches for 
the minimum of a parabola in an arbitrary amount of dimensions, using 
variables whose value range is constrained. Program options are specified 
through a configuration file, likewise options affecting the parabola 
(dimension, parameter constraints) can be specified in a configuration file.
The example can be easily adapted to specific problems by changing the evaluation
function and adding further, custom code. It is self-contained and can be 
compiled outside of the Geneva source tree.
