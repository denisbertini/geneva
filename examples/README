This directory contains some examples of how to use the Geneva library. 
Please check each directory for further information. Where no README file
is available, the main source code file (usually named similar to the 
directory it is in) will usually have further information. Note that there
is also a complete example, including tests, under "associated/GStartProject".
It is suggested to use that example as a starting point for your own 
optimization programs.
