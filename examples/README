Geneva library - Examples
=========================

This directory contains some examples of how to use the Geneva library.

Note that there is a complete example, including tests, which you can use
as a starting point for your own optimization programs. This example is
called "GStartProject".


The list of examples includes several simple ones:

- GMultiPopulation:   a multi-population use example.
- GSimpleEA:          an evolutionary algorithm optimization example.
- GSimpleSwarm:       a swarm-based optimization example.

You will also find here some more complete programs, which are intended
as starting points for your own work and might, in some cases, also be
used directly without adaption. These are:

- GExternalEvaluator: a framework for using external evaluation programs
                      for the evaluation step.
- GNeuralNetwork:     an implementation of feed forward neural networks,
                      which are trained with Geneva.
- GStartProject:      a framework meant as a starting point for your own
                      Geneva-based optimization program.

Please check each directory for further information. Where no README file
is available, the main source code file (named similar to the directory it
is in) will have further information.


Compilation
===========

All the examples in this folder are compiled when building the whole Geneva
tree. However, you can also give any of these examples a try by compiling it
in a stand-alone way.

For compiling a given example proceed as follows:

- Create a "build" folder somewhere and change into it:
	mkdir /tmp/build
	cd /tmp/build

- Run cmake with the appropriate options:
	cmake -DBOOSTROOT=<PATH_TO_BOOST_ROOT> -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR="${BOOSTROOT}/lib" \
	      -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR="${BOOSTROOT}/include/boost" \
	      -DGENEVA_ROOT=<PATH_TO_GENEVA_INSTALL_DIR> \
	      -DGENEVA_BUILD_TYPE=[Release|Debug] \
	      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH_TO_GENEVA_EXAMPLE_INSTALL_DIR> \
	      -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=[0|1] -DBUILDTESTCODE=[0|1] \
	      		<PATH_TO_EXAMPLE_SOURCE_DIR>
  In particular, if the Boost libraries are installed system-wide you will most
  probably only need the GENEVA_ROOT variable and you can simply try with:
	cmake -DGENEVA_ROOT=/opt/geneva \
	      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/geneva-examples geneva-src/examples/GSimpleEA/

- Build and install the example:
	make
	make install
