This example shows how to deal with boundary conditions of the type x+y+z < C in Geneva, 
where x,y and z are parameters to be optimized. Note that Geneva assumes that functions
describing such boundary conditions never return values < 0. Values > 1 indicate invalid 
parameter sets. Values between 0 and 1 are always valid.
