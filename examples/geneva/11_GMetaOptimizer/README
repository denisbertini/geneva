This directory contains a performance tuning application that
allows to find optimal optimization parameters for a given individual 
type. The target function is the average amount of calls to the 
individual's objective function over the course of an optimization
run, which needs to be minimized. Thus, with this application, you
can tune the parameters of optimization algorithms themselves.
The supplied "GMetaOptimizerIndividual" encapsulates different 
optimization algorithms.

Note that the example currently only covers the optimization of
the parameters of evolutionary algorithms, but that it can easily
be extended to other algorithm types.
