This directory contains a simple use case of multi criterion optimization.
A user-defined number of parabolas with adjustable location of their minimum represent 
possibly opposing evaluation criteria. Geneva's EA implementation of pareto-front 
optimization is used to tackle this problem. Make sure that the parameter "sortingMode"
is set to 3 or 4 in config/GEvolutionaryAlgorithm.json (this is the default in 
the configuration file provided with this example).
