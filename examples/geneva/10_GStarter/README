This directory contains an example that may be directly used 
as the basis for your own optimization problems. In particular,
it shows a different way of adding optimization algorithms to the
Go2 class. NOTE: As a result, the multi-threaded variant of 
evolutionary algorithms will be executed first in this example,
regardless of what other algorithms you might have specified on
the command line. E.g., if you start the program with "./GFunctionMinimizer -a swarm",
a multi-threaded evolutionary algorithm will be started first
(because it was added in main() ), followed by a multi-threaded
swarm (because multi-threaded execution is the default in Geneva).
Hence this example is not recommended as the general starting 
point for Geneva-beginners. Note that the swarm algorithm will
start with the best indivivdual found by the evolutionary algorithm.
