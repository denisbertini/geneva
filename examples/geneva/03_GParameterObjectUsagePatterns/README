This sample program illustrates the usage of Geneva's parameter objects. 
GParameterObject-derivatives are the main vehicle through which optimization
parameters are specified. There is a whole family of parameter objects.

We use again the GFunctionIndividual class, although here its main purpose
is to serve as a container for parameter objects.
