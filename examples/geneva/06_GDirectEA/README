This directory contains a simple Geneva application that searches for
the minimum of a function, using an evolutionary strategy. Parallelisation
can happen at your choice in networked mode, via threads or in serial mode.

The example demonstrates how the functionality of a given optimization
algorithm can be accessed directly. NOTE: Usually, the user will not do so, but will
rather use the Go2 class, which wraps all necessary functionality. However, there
may be special use cases where one might want to interact directly with a given
optimization algorithm.

Call the example program with --help to find out about available options.
