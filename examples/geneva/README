Geneva library - Examples
=========================

This directory contains some examples of how to use the Geneva library.
Examples starting with 01-08 are explained in the Geneva manual (see
http://www.gemfony.com/fileadmin/documentation/geneva-manual.pdf )

You will also find here some more complete programs, which are intended
as starting points for your own work and might, in some cases, also be
used directly without adaption. These are:

- GNeuralNetwork:     an implementation of feed forward neural networks,
                      which are trained with Geneva.

Please check each directory for further information. Where no README file
is available, the main source code file (named similar to the directory it
is in) will have further information.

Compilation
===========

All the examples in this folder are compiled when building the whole Geneva
tree. However, you can also give any of these examples a try by compiling it
"stand-alone", provided the correct version of the Geneva library is available
on your system.

For compiling a given example proceed as follows:

- Create a "build" folder somewhere and change into it:
	mkdir /tmp/build
	cd /tmp/build

- Run cmake with the appropriate options:
	cmake -DBOOSTROOT=<PATH_TO_BOOST_ROOT> -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR="${BOOSTROOT}/lib" \
	      -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR="${BOOSTROOT}/include/boost" \
	      -DGENEVA_ROOT=<PATH_TO_GENEVA_INSTALL_DIR> \
	      -DGENEVA_BUILD_TYPE=[Release|Debug] \
	      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<PATH_TO_GENEVA_EXAMPLE_INSTALL_DIR> \
	      -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=[0|1] -DGENEVA_BUILD_TESTS=[0|1] \
	      		<PATH_TO_EXAMPLE_SOURCE_DIR>
  In particular, if the Boost libraries are installed system-wide you will most
  probably only need the GENEVA_ROOT variable and you can simply try with:
	cmake -DGENEVA_ROOT=/opt/geneva \
	      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/geneva-examples geneva-src/examples/GSimpleEA/

- Build and install the example:
	make
	make install
