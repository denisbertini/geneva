This directory contains an optimization program that uses external executables
for the evaluation of parameter sets. This can be useful if the code of these 
executables is not readily available or cannot be integrated into Geneva, e.g. 
for licensing reasons. Note that calling an external executable for each evaluation
implies a significant overhead. Whenever possible, we thus recommend to write
native individuals instead.
