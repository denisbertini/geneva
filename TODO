Goals for the near future
-------------------------
- Offer suitable documentation
- Offer various parts of the library as separate packages. Important
  examples are the broker code and the random number factory.
- Work on portability and a more comfortable installation
- Integrate other optimization techniques, such as a gradient descent
  or swarm algorithms
- Remove boost::xtime in favour of date_time, see http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/doc/html/thread/changes.html
