Dr. Ruediger Berlich is the main author of the library, which has 
been developed with kind support from Helmholtz society and from 
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Dr. Ariel Garcia has increasingly
taken over work in the ongoing development.

We'd also like to sincerely thank Dr. Sven Gabriel for his kind support 
and for discovering numerous problems.
