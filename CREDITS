Dr. Ruediger Berlich is the main author of the library, which has 
been developed with kind support from Helmholtz society and from 
Steinbuch Centre for Computing at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (as
well as other departments). Dr. Ariel Garcia has increasingly taken 
over work in the ongoing development.

We'd also like to sincerely thank Dr. Sven Gabriel for his kind support 
and for discovering numerous problems.

Alexander Mueller has made many suggestions, discovered bugs and has given
important advice for porting Geneva to Windows. 

Lisa Schaetzle has helped with the improvement of the Gradient Descent 
implementation.
