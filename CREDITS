The Geneva library has been developed with kind support from the
Helmholtz Society and from the Steinbuch Centre for Computing at
the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (as well as other departments).

We'd also like to sincerely thank Dr. Sven Gabriel for his kind
support and for discovering numerous problems.

Alexander Mueller (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg)
has made many suggestions, discovered bugs and has given important advice
for porting Geneva to Windows. 

Lisa Schaetzle has helped with the improvement of the Gradient Descent 
implementation.

Dominik Rödel and Felix Zürker of Tenneco Automotive made many valuable 
suggestions during a joint project dealing with the optimization of the 
acoustics of exhaust systems.

The work with Prof. Dr. Matthias Lutz of GSI Darmstadt on scalability 
issues and optimization efficiency of a particular use case from particle 
physics has helped to make Geneva a more mature and versatile solution.
