The Geneva library was initially developed by Dr. Ruediger Berlich
with kind support by the Helmholtz Society and by Steinbuch Centre
for Computing at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (as well as
other departments). It is now being maintained by Dr. Ruediger Berlich
and Dr. Ariel Garcia of Gemfony scientific.

We'd also like to sincerely thank Dr. Sven Gabriel for his kind
support and for discovering numerous problems.

Alexander Müller of the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-
Nürnberg has made many suggestions, discovered bugs and has given
important advice for porting Geneva to Windows. 

Lisa Schätzle has helped with the improvement of the Gradient Descent 
implementation.

Mathias Michel of Mainz University has kindly shared his experiences 
during the deployment of Geneva in a package used for Dalitz plot 
analysis and thus helped to mature Geneva.

Dominik Rödel and Felix Zürker of Tenneco Clean Air Europe made
many valuable suggestions during a joint project dealing with the
optimization of the acoustics of exhaust systems.

The work with Prof. Dr. Matthias Lutz and Dr. Kilian Schwarz of
GSI Darmstadt on scalability issues and optimization efficiency
of a particular use case from particle physics has helped to make
Geneva a more mature and versatile solution.
