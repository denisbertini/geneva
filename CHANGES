* Version 0.5.3, "Building 39" - yet unreleased

The main changes for this release include:
 - Made the library compile (mostly clean) with the Intel 10.1 compiler.
 - Made the library compile cleanly with the old GNU g++ 3.4.6
 - Made the package size produced by the GRandomFactory changeable at run-time
 - Allow for random numbers to be produced locally in each GRandom object, if desired. 
   This makes it possible to assign many more parameters to an individual
 - Moved away from the Boost random number generator for local generation mode
   due to its large memory requirements
 - Add possibility to compile the library/executables statically

* Version 0.5.2 "Building 38" - April 20, 2009

The main changes for this release include:
 - Created a unit test framework for most classes in Geneva.
 - Added modules for the "standardized" exchange of data with external
   evaluation programs.
 - Added new container for bounded doubles, as well as a bounded int32.
 - Made vector-wrapper more complete and derived classes with vector
   interface from a common vector wrapper base class.

* Version 0.5.1 "Ferney-Voltaire" - March 20, 2009

Again a long list of changes, too long to mention here. Check the SVN
pages for details. Development is still very dynamic.

October 23, 2008: Too many changes have been made in the software to be
named here. This was partially in the course of searching for problems 
that in the end turned out not to be on Geneva's side. We nevertheless 
believe that the library has improved a lot. Not the least, we have 
started to integrate the Boost.Test suite of unit testing tools. We will 
aim at listing major changes in the code here in the future, as they 
occur.

* Version 0.5 "Meyrin" - September 15, 2008

* Version 0.4 "CERN-barracks" - July 7, 2008
