Added new container for bounded doubles, as well as a bounded int32
Made vector-wrapper more complete and derived classes with vector interface from a common vector wrapper base class

March 20, 2009: Again a long list of changes, too long to mention here. Check the
SVN pages for details. Development is still very dynamic. 

October 23, 2008: Too many changes have been made in the software to be
named here. This was partially in the course of searching for problems that 
in the end turned out not to be on Geneva's side. We nevertheless believe 
that the library has improved a lot. Not the least, we have started to 
integrate the Boost.Test suite of unit testing tools. We will aim at listing
major changes in the code here in the future, as they occur. 

July 31, 2008: Complete revision of the entire project (due to become 
version 0.5). Yet uncomplete. Also moved from GNU autotools to CMake.
Directory structure of SVN repository has been revised.
