Wishlist for future Geneva development:
---------------------------------------

Feature- and API-additions:

 - A scripting interface to optimization algorithms, so that new
   algorithms can be more easily implemented and tested even by
   people not familiar with all of Geneva.
 - A "Python-Individual", so that optimization algorithms may be
   specified in Python.
 - Additional optimization algorithms (particularly Simplex and
   Conjugate Gradient).
 - Variable length parents and best individuals in evolutionary algorithms
   to better support pareto optimization.
 - A simple interface to influence the process of optimization (in particular
   checkpointing, termination and continuation of the program as well as
   extraction of the current best solutions as a result of user-demands.

API-compatible changes:

 - Make value ranges of parameter objects always closed, even for fp.
 - Automatic recreation and distribution of relevant configuration files.
 - Full integration of -fsanitize=X.
 - Rework of the test infrastructure.
