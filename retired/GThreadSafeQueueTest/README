This directory contains a manual test / usage demo of the GThreadSafeQueue class,
which lets you buffer data / objects between different threads.

- Random number containers are produced by producers and are submitted to the queue wrapped
in a std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr or natively. Consumers retrieve  work items from the
queue, sort them and return them to the producers through another queue.
