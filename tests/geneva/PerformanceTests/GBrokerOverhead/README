This directory contains a simple Geneva application that searches for 
the minimum of a function. Parallelisation can happen at your choice
through the Boost.Thread consumer (instead of the "usual" ASIO-based
consumer), directly through threads or in serial mode. This allows to
measure the overhead introduced through the broker infrastructure.
