This folder contains a test that tries to measure the time needed for serialization of 
a complex individual and compares it with the time needed for its adaption. It does so
for different sizes of the individual (i.e. different amounts of parameters) and graphically
plots the amount of time needed for each time. The idea is to find out whether adaption 
should rather happen on the server or the client side in networked execution.
