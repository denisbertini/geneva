This folder contains an application that, instead of performing
calculations in the evaluation function, waits for a predefined
amount of time. As this makes the run time independent of the underlying
calculation and e.g. the load on client- and server-systems, this
allows us to measure the theoretically possible speedup for a given
amount of data exchange and length of the evaluation procedure, dependant
on the local environment. Furthermore, we can measure the overhead that
is jointly introduced by the broker infrastructure, serialization and
network transfers.

A serial measurement will be started in parallel to your measurement,
as a reference point. The serial measurement will only calculate
the first few data points and then extrapolate.

ATTENTION: This test can run for a VERY long time

The result is a ROOT-file result.C, which you can look at with a command
similar to

root -l result.C

provided you have installed ROOT on your system (see http://root.cern.ch
for further information).
