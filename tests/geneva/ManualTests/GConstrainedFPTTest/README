This test takes a GConstrainedDoubleObject object:
a) It examines the mapping from internal to external representation of its value.
b) It tests the "distortion" of a gaussian when going through the mapping from
   internal to external value.

Additional tests (including error handling) of the GConstrainedDoubleObject class have been
implemented as part of the unit tests.

In order to see the results of this test, you need the Root toolkit from http://root.cern.ch.
Once installed call "root -l mapping.C" .
