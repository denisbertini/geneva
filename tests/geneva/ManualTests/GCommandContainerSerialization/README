This test (de-)serializes the GCommandContainerT many times with all available commands,
using the GFunctionIndividual as payload. The GFunctionIndividual-object is randomly
initialized and evaluated when de-serialized. It is then serialized and de-serialized
again in order to mimic what happens during remot processing of Geneva payloads.
