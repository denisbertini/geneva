This directory contains tests for instantiable classes. 
Many parent classes in Geneva are purely virtual. So unless you
will find a test for them here, their functionality 
is tested through an instantiable derived class. 

The current test setup is modeled after the documentation of 
Boost.Test, with additional information taken from 
http://www.hpfsc.de/boosttest/
