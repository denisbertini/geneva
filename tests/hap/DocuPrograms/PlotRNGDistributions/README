This directory contains a simple program that creates an output file
for the Geneva documentation. It contains different random number 
distributions and must be viewed with the ROOT analysis framework 
(see http://root.cern.ch). 

After calling the main executable, run 

root -l rootPlotRNGDistributions.C

The result will be a number of PNG files suitable for inclusion in 
the documentation.
