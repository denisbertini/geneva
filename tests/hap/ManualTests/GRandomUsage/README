This test creates NENTRIES random numbers each for numbers and items with
different characteristics. Each set is created in its own thread.
Note that the random numbers are usually not created in the GRandomT
object, but by the GRandomFactory class in a different thread.
GRandomT just acts as a proxy.

The results of the test are output in the ROOT format. See
http://root.cern.ch for further information.

You can look at the graphical results with the command

root -l randomResult.C
