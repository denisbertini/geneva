This folder contains an application that, instead of performing 
calculations in the evaluation function, waits for a predefined 
amount of time. As this makes the run time independent of the underlying
calculation and e.g. the load on client- and server-systems, this 
allows us to measure the theoretically possible speedup for a given
amount of data exchange and length of the evaluation procedure. 
Furthermore, we can measure the overhead that is jointly introduced 
by the broker infrastructure, serialization and network transfers.
