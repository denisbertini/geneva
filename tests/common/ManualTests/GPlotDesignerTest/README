This directory contains a manual test / usage demo of the GPlotDesigner family
of classes, which lets you produce ROOT (cmp. http://root.cern.ch) plots in an 
intuitive way. The library will create input files for ROOT, which can then be 
further processed.

In order to try out the example, after calling the executable, have a llok at
the file result.C with a text editor -- it was created with GPlotDesigner and
associated classes. Then, if ROOT is in your path, execute

root -l ./result.C
