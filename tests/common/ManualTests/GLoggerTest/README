This directory contains a manual test / usage demo of the GLogger class.
It allows to stream data to a logger in a simple way like this:

glogger << "Some information " << 1 << " " << 2 << someStreamableType << GLOGGER;

It also allows to raise exceptions in the same, easy way, using the modifier GEXCEPTION.

Call the program and you will see some shell-output through the console logger. Also,
a number of files will have been created (--> file logging). Note that access to the
logger is thread safe, so it can also be used as an easy output mechanism. Note though,
that there might be a performance penalty.

Note that the application is meant to crash when called with the --crash option. This
is meant to check whether we can navigate to the throw-site with a debugger.
