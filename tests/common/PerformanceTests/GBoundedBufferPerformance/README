This program tests the performance and reliability of the
GBoundedBufferT class by producing and consuming many double
values from within concurrent threads. The bounded buffer, as
the name suggests, acts as the buffer between producer and
consumer. This example both stress-tests the buffer and tests
its performance.

The line "#define GEM_COMMON_BENCHMARK_BOUNDED_BUFFER" at the
beginning of GBoundedBufferPerformance.cpp forces the bounded
buffer to emit data in the form of a ROOT script. Display the
file result.C with ROOT (see http://root.cern.ch) after the
executable has run with the command

root -l ./result.C
