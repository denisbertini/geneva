This directory contains a number of programs built on top of the Geneva library. Note that these programs 
are not part of the normal build process but should be compiled individually. Suitable CMakeLists.txt files
are provided, but might need some adaption to work in your environment.

- GExternalEvaluator: A framework for using external evaluation functions for the evaluation step
- GNeuralNetwork: An implementation of feed forward neural networks, which are trained with Geneva
- GStartProject: A simple framework meant as a starting point for your own optimization program, based on Geneva
