This directory contains tools and programs that can help to taylor Geneva to a particular purpose. 
They are not all included in the build process, as they might require external libraries.

ExternalOpenBabel: 
Uses the GExternalProgram example to perform optimization of protein structures, making use of the
OpenBabel library. Note that this particular program is covered by the GPL2 (in contrast to most
other parts of Geneva) in order to comply with OpenBabel's license requirements. For further
information on OpenBabel see http://www.openbabel.org . Note that this program is not currently included
in the build process, as the OpenBabel libraries would be needed (available from the above URL).
