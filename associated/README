This directory contains a number of self-contained programs built on top of the Geneva library. Note that these 
programs  are not part of the normal build process but represent independent units. Suitable CMakeLists.txt files
are provided, but might need some adaption to work in your environment. The programs are intended as starting
points for own work and might, in sime cases, also be used directly without adaption.

- GExternalEvaluator: A framework for using external evaluation functions for the evaluation step
- GNeuralNetwork: An implementation of feed forward neural networks, which are trained with Geneva
- GStartProject: A simple framework meant as a starting point for your own optimization program, based on Geneva
