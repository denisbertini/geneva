This program uses the GExternalProgram example to perform optimization
of protein structures, making use of the OpenBabel library. Note that
this particular program is covered by the GPL2 (in contrast to most
other parts of Geneva) in order to comply with OpenBabel's license
requirements. For further information on OpenBabel see
http://www.openbabel.org . Note that this program is not currently
included in the build process of the Geneva library, as the OpenBabel
libraries would be needed (available from the above URL).

In order to use this program, you will need a PDB description of a molecule.

Optimization can be done with a command like the following:

/some/path/GExternalProgram -f ./eminim2 -e "-n ./some/file.pdb" -X 0 -a 1 -G 4000 -z 100 -Z 1

This would use the eminim2 program to evaluate different molecular
configurations.
