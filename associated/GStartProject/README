This directory contains a simple Geneva application that searches for 
the minimum of a parabola, using variables whose value range is constrained.
Program options are specified through a configuration file. The example
can be easily adapted to specific problems by changing the evaluation
function and adding further, custom code. It is self-contained and includes
unit test code. It is suggested to test your individuals, once they have been
completed.
